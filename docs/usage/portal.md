# Portal

`sandman portal` starts a local browser view for the current repository's Sandman instances. It is repo-scoped, so it only shows runs discovered under the checked-out project's `.sandman/batches/` tree.

## Start it

```bash
sandman portal
```

By default, the portal binds to `127.0.0.1:5000` (loopback only) so it does not expose a dev server on every interface. If you need a different port, pass `--port`:

```bash
sandman portal --port 5050
```

### Expose the portal on another interface

The default loopback bind keeps the portal reachable only from the same machine. To expose it on a different host or interface (for example, on all interfaces so another device on the network can reach it), pass `--host`:

```bash
sandman portal --host 0.0.0.0
```

You can also set the `SANDMAN_PORTAL_HOST` environment variable to change the default bind host before launching:

```bash
export SANDMAN_PORTAL_HOST=0.0.0.0
sandman portal
```

`SANDMAN_PORTAL_HOST` only changes the default; an explicit `--host` flag always wins. The address printed at startup reflects the host the server is actually bound on.

When the server starts, it prints the URL to open in your browser.

## What it shows

- Live Sandman instances in the current repository
- Active and completed runs from `.sandman/events.jsonl`

The runs table displays these columns: **Run**, **Status**, **Started**, **Duration**, **Issue Title**, **Branch**, and **Actions**. The Issue Title column shows the GitHub issue title for runs with that data available, or an em-dash for historical or prompt-only runs. Source information (socket and log file paths) remains visible in the Details tab when expanding a run.

The portal rescans the repository on each poll, so new `sandman run` processes appear without restarting it.

### Review run identity in the portal

Review runs are ordinary AgentRuns. Each row in the runs table — including review runs — is keyed by a canonical per-row RunID minted per [ADR-0030](../adr/0030-standardize-run-id-and-run-dir.md) §Per-row RunID templates:

- **Review without a linked issue:** the row RunID is `<ts>-<sid>-PR<pr>` (e.g. `260625120000-abcd-PR42`).
- **Review with a linked issue:** the row RunID is `<ts>-<sid>-<linkedIssue>-PR<pr>` (e.g. `260625120000-abcd-1551-PR42`).

The row folder under `.sandman/batches/<batch-id>/runs/<runID>/` is named after that per-row RunID — never after a `runs/review` alias — so logs, sockets, and `review-state.json` live under a folder whose name matches the row identity surfaced in the UI. `.sandman/reviews/` is reserved for the review daemon's own files (`review.sock`, `review-prompt.md`) and never holds per-row run folders. See `CONTEXT.md` §Review run for the canonical glossary entry.

### Public BatchId vs per-row RunID

The portal surfaces two distinct identifiers per the slice-1 contract ([ADR-0030](../adr/0030-standardize-run-id-and-run-dir.md) and [ADR-0032](../adr/0032-sandman-layout-redesign.md) §`batch.json` schema and §Row-level action resolution identity table):

- **Public BatchId** — the batch-level identifier rendered in the Batch label and Details tab. Equals the batch folder basename (`batches/<id>/`'s last segment), `batch.json.batchId`, `run.json.BatchID`, and the event payload `batch_id`.
- **Per-row RunID** — the row-level identifier rendered per row and used by row-level actions (archive, abort, log download). Equals `run.json.runID` and the event payload `run_id`.

For multi-issue batches the two diverge: the public BatchId carries the `+N` additional count suffix and the per-row RunID does not. For every other kind (single-issue, prompt-only, review, auto-select) the two are identical. See [ADR-0032](../adr/0032-sandman-layout-redesign.md) §Row-level action resolution for the full kind-by-kind identity table.

### Continuation history

Continuation runs started with `sandman run --continue` appear as separate rows with their own RunID and Batch label. The continued row keeps a `previous_run_id` link in its events, and the expanded-row subject picker includes that previous run as a selectable sibling when it is present in the portal data.

Use the picker to switch between the continuation and the previous run without changing the table row. Selecting the previous run shows its own log, events, and details, so lineage stays navigable while each run remains independently addressable for row-level actions.

### Existing `.sandman` migration is out of scope

**Existing `.sandman` migration is out of scope.** The slice-1 contract change (issue #1917) and the identity alignment that followed (slices 2–6 of parent PRD #1916) rename the public BatchId surface and the per-row RunID templates. Batches provisioned before the contract change carry old id shapes (legacy `+1` single-issue, total-count `+N`, prompt-only without the `prompt` segment, etc.) and are not rewritten in place. After upgrading, the operator should delete `.sandman` and rebuild; no migration tool ships for the old layout.

- **Public BatchId** — the batch-level identifier rendered in the Batch label and Details tab. Equals the batch folder basename (`batches/<id>/`'s last segment), `batch.json.batchId`, `run.json.BatchID`, and the event payload `batch_id`.

## Stop (Abort)

Use the **Stop** button in the portal UI to abort a running issue. The portal calls:

```
POST /api/runs/abort
{"runKey": "<run-key>", "issue": <N>}
```

The endpoint signals the command server and waits for the AgentRun to abort, returning:

```json
{"runKey": "...", "issue": <N>, "status": "aborted", "scope": "issue"}
```

Abort is available on Linux and macOS; other platforms return `501 Not Implemented`.

## Log streaming

```
GET /api/runs/<key>/log
```

Returns live output as `text/plain; charset=utf-8`. The handler reads from the control socket first, falling back to the log file if the socket is empty or unavailable.

Special states return fixed messages:

| Status | Message |
|--------|---------|
| `blocked` | `Blocked. Waiting on unresolved blockers.` (or listed blocker issue numbers) |
| `queued` | `Queued. Waiting to start.` |

## Archive

Use the **Archive** button on a completed row to move that single run to `.sandman/archive/<batchId>/runs/<runId>/`. The portal calls:

```
POST /api/runs/archive
{"runId": "<per-row RunID>"}
```

The endpoint is strictly per-row: it accepts only the row RunID, validates the row's `run.json.Status` is terminal (success / failure / aborted / blocked), and returns:

- empty `200` on success — the next `/api/runs` poll re-renders the row with the `Archived` chip and updates the log download URL to point at `.sandman/archive/<batchId>/runs/<runId>/run.log`
- `409` with `{"error": "...", "archivePath": "..."}` when the row is already archived; the body echoes the existing archive path so the operator can inspect it
- `409` with a non-terminal message when the row's `run.json.Status` is still `active`
- `404` when the row id does not resolve on disk or in the index

The portal does not dispatch per-row vs whole-batch — the HTTP surface only exposes per-row archive. Whole-batch archive (`sandman archive batch <batchId>`) is a CLI-only subcommand.

## HTTP API

The portal serves six HTTP endpoints under `/api/`. Two are documented in dedicated sections above; all six are summarised here for reference.

### `GET /api/instances`

Returns the list of live Sandman daemon instances currently active in the repository.

**Response** `200 OK` — `application/json`

```json
{
  "repoRoot": "/path/to/repo",
  "instances": [
    {
      "name": "<batch-id>",
      "socketPath": "/path/to/batch.sock"
    }
  ]
}
```

`instances` is sorted alphabetically by batch id. Entries with inactive sockets are excluded.

### `GET /api/runs`

Returns the current run table for the portal UI. Supports three variants via query parameters:

| Parameter | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| (none) | Full snapshot of all runs |
| `?runKey=<per-row RunID>` | Single-row keyed lookup; see [ADR-0032](../adr/0032-sandman-layout-redesign.md) §Row-level action resolution identity |
| `?summary=1` | Condensed snapshot for the portal table; includes `ETag` / `304 Not Modified` caching |

**Response** `200 OK` — `application/json`

Full snapshot and summary variants return `runs` as an array:

```json
{
  "repoRoot": "/path/to/repo",
  "runs": [
    {
      "key": "<per-row RunID>",
      "runId": "<per-row RunID>",
      "kind": "issue|review|prompt",
      "status": "active|success|failure|blocked|aborted|archived|queued",
      "issueLabel": "#1234",
      "issueNumber": 1234,
      "branch": "feature-branch",
      "startedAt": "2025-06-25T12:00:00Z",
      "finishedAt": "2025-06-25T12:34:56Z",
      "duration": "34m56s",
      "lastOutputAt": "2025-06-25T12:34:00Z",
      "socketPath": "/path/to/run.sock",
      "logPath": ".sandman/batches/<batchId>/runs/<runId>/run.log",
      "logUrl": "/api/logs?path=.sandman/batches/<batchId>/runs/<runId>/run.log",
      "review": false,
      "reviewCount": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The single-row keyed lookup returns `run` (singular) instead of `runs`:

```json
{
  "repoRoot": "/path/to/repo",
  "run": { ... }
}
```

Not all fields appear in every row. `lastOutputAt`, `socketPath`, and `logUrl` are omitted for terminal rows. `review`, `reviewCount`, and `reviewVerdict` are only present for rows that own child review runs.

### `GET /api/runs/stream`

Server-Sent Events stream of live run output. Used by the portal UI for real-time updates without polling.

**Query parameter**: `?runKey=<per-row RunID>` (required)

**Response** `200 OK` — `text/event-stream`

Each output line from the run's control socket is emitted as a separate SSE `data:` event:

```
data: <cleaned line>\n\n
```

Lines are cleaned server-side (ANSI escapes stripped, control bytes removed) to match the `run.log` contract. A `:` keepalive comment is sent every 15 seconds when no output has flowed. The stream ends when the client disconnects or the daemon closes the control socket.

Errors return JSON with an appropriate HTTP status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `400` | Missing `runKey` |
| `409` | Run is not active |
| `502` | Cannot connect to the run's control socket |

### `GET /api/logs`

Serves the run log file at the requested path. Used by the portal UI to download or view run output.

**Query parameter**: `?path=<relative-path>` (required)

The path must be inside `.sandman/` and match the permitted pattern (`batches/<batchId>/runs/<runId>/run.log` or `archive/<batchId>/runs/<runId>/run.log`). See [ADR-0032](../adr/0032-sandman-layout-redesign.md) §Row-level action resolution identity for how `path` is derived from a per-row RunID lookup.

**Response** `200 OK` — `application/octet-stream`

The log file is served as an attachment with `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="run.log"`.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `400` | Missing or invalid `path` |
| `404` | File not found |

### `POST /api/runs/abort`

Signals a running issue to abort. See [## Stop (Abort)](#stop-abort) above.

### `POST /api/runs/archive`

Archives a single completed row. See [## Archive](#archive) above.
